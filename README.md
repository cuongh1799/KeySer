# Project: KeySer

## Ever you feel annoyed when you have to reach for your mouse (or touchpad) when you are so in deep within the coding space ?

This project inspired by the VIM system, but aims to be more simple and for controlling cursor movement, including moving and clicking, dragging... you name it.

I'm planning to do this in C# with .NET 8.0 Framework, further information are still being research :)
